Multistage builds is used to reduce the size of the image, suppose if you are running npm install, followed by ng build for angular cli framework build compoenents, you will get the distribution folder.
So you can copy the distribution folder to the docker image itself.
There can be n stages of build, they are referred by "AS buildname". Example is as follows.

# Stage 1: Build an Angular Docker Image
FROM node as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json /app/
RUN npm install
COPY . /app
ARG configuration=production
RUN npm run build -- --outputPath=./dist/out --configuration $configuration
# Stage 2, use the compiled app, ready for production with Nginx
FROM nginx
COPY --from=build /app/dist/out/ /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY /nginx-custom.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

MEMORY in docker restiction(Handled by CGROUP an kernel feature)
Docker CRI can restrict the container based on Memory and CPU
use the --memory and --memory-swap flags with the docker run command


CPU Restriction in DOCKER(Handled by CGROUP an kernel feature)
Restrict CPU utilization using the --cpu-shares flag with the docker run command:
$ docker run -d --name kuard \
--publish 8080:8080 \
--memory 200m \
--memory-swap 1G \
--cpu-shares 1024 \
gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:blue
